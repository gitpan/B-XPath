    B::XPath - search Perl optrees with XPath syntax

    Perl represents programs internally as a tree of opcodes. To execute a
    program, it walks this tree, performing each operation as it encounters
    it. The B family of modules allows you to examine (and in some cases,
    manipulate) this optree on programs *even as they run*.

    B::XPath allows you to use XPath syntax to select ops in the optree.
